# Vote Chatbot for Zoom

This is a sample Chatbot app using the [Zoom Chatbot NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zoomus/chatbot).

## Install and Run Locally

`$ git clone https://github.com/zoom/vote-chatbot.git`

`$ cd vote-chatbot`

`$ npm install`

`$ touch .env`

Add this code to your `.env` file, replacing the `Required` text with your respective **Development** Zoom Chatbot API credentials.

```
client_id=Required
client_secret=Required
redirect_url=Required
verification_token=Required
bot_jid=Required
slash_command=Required
verification_code=Optional
```

`$ npm run start` or `$ nodemon` ([for live reload / file change detection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon))

`$ ngrok http 4000` ([ngrok turns localhost into live server](https://ngrok.com/) so slash commands and user actions can be sent to your app)

Open your ngrok https url in a browser, you should see this,

`Welcome to the Vote Chatbot for Zoom!`

On your App Marketplace Dashboard, add your ngrok https url to your Whitelist URLs (App Credentials Page), **Development** Redirect URL for OAuth (App Credentials Page), and **Development** Bot Endpoint URL (Features Page). Make sure to match the path after your ngrok https url with the express routes in index.js.

> In order to click the **Save** button on the Features page when adding a Slash Command and Development Bot Endpoint URL, you have to provide a Production Bot Endpoint URL. Feel free to use https://zoom.us as a placeholder.

Double check your `.env` file is complete (don't forget the redirect_url).

> Nodemon does not watch changes in `.env` file so restart your nodemon server (NOT ngrok). CTRL C then `$ nodemon`

After that, your app is ready to be installed!

On your App Marketplace Dashboard, go to the **Local Test** page and click **Install**. After you click the **Authorize** button, you should be taken to your redirect url and see this,

`Thanks for installing the Vote Chatbot for Zoom!`


Now that your Chatbot is installed on your Zoom account, go to a Zoom Chat channel and type,

`/vote Tacos for lunch?`

## Deploy to Production

In this example we will deploy our Chatbot to a [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) Node.js Server.

`$ heroku create`

`$ git add -A`

`$ git commit -m "deploying to heroku"`

`$ git push heroku master`

After heroku completes the app upload process open your app,

`$ heroku open`

In your browser you should see,

`Welcome to the Vote Chatbot for Zoom!`

Now go to your [Heroku App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), click on the **Settings** tab, and to add your **Production** Zoom API Credentials to the **Config Vars** section.

Then on your Zoom App Dashboard, go to the **Submit** page and click the **Add to Zoom** button to install the Production version of your app to your Zoom Account.

Now that your Chatbot is installed on your Zoom account, go to a Zoom Chat channel and type,

`/vote Tacos for lunch?`
